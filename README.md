# Calculator

A simple web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Reset button (`AC`) to clear the input.
- Delete button (`DE`) to remove the last character.
- Decimal point input.
- Supports multiple digits including `00`.


## How it Works

The calculator takes inputs from buttons and displays them in a text box. When the equal (`=`) button is pressed, the JavaScript `eval()` function processes the input string to calculate the result.
